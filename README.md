# wdb-simple-heroku
A tiny, simple application to learn deploying to Heroku.

## Notes
This required a bit of fiddling to make it work with *Gitpod*. A **Dockerfile** was created, based on the main *Gitpod* **Dockerfile**, with the only addition being the *heroku cli*. 
In the future, it's more likely that I'll use *heroku* hooks directly to GitHub to build and deploy.
